# Processing
Dump of my old Processing programs
<br>
As part of my Object Oriented Programming Language module (CS1OOP), during my first year of university, we made use of Processing.
<br>
Processing is a simplified form of Java to introduce students to OO concepts in an easier way. (It's not very good)
<br>
This is an archive of everything I made use of during my time using Processing.
